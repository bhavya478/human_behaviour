Human Behavior analysis is a behavioral science discipline focused on how behaviorâ€™s change or affected by the environment. Aim of action recognition is to automatically identify the action of a person based on some kind of sensor data. Also, we can detect the behavior among a group of individuals which can be achieved by the interpretation of data gained studying the natural movement of groups or objects. Masses of bodies, particularly human, are the subjects of these crowds tracking analysis that include how a particular crowd moves and when a movement pattern changes.
