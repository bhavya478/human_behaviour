Human Behavior analysis is a behavioral science discipline focused on how behavior’s change or affected by the environment. Aim of action recognition is to automatically identify the action of a person based on some kind of sensor data. Also, we can detect the behavior among a group of individuals which can be achieved by the interpretation of data gained studying the natural movement of groups or objects. Masses of bodies, particularly human, are the subjects of these crowds tracking analysis that include how a particular crowd moves and when a movement pattern changes. 
In a classroom environment, one of the biggest obstacles you may face is dealing with children with challenging behavior. Not only does the child affect you trying to teach a lesson and maintain control, but they also disrupt the productivity of the class as a whole. Children who display challenging behavior don’t usually do so ‘just because they want to’.There’s often a reason behind their behavior or it might be their only way of telling you
something’s wrong. All behavior is a form of communication.
In this context, by using or applying technology to the classroom environment it helps the teacher’s or professors in effective management of classroom by getting to know how many students are paying attention in the respective class or lecture and take necessary steps to make the lecture more interesting or engaging.
